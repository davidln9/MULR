# MULR

My Ultimate Language Recognizer is currently capable of matching input against a context free grammar.
Goal: generate and execute parse trees similar to ANTLR but without the need for forward engineering source code to be compiled later.
This is free and open source software, written in the spirit of academic and experimental pursuits.
Pull requests may or may not be answered and updates will be infrequent due to college/day job commitments.

Usage: <executable_file> <input_file> <grammar_file>
